# EnigmaCode-

# Anonymous Research Artifact

 

This repository contains the anonymized artifact accompanying a submission on secure delegated quantum optimization. 

It is provided solely for peer-review purposes and will be publicly released upon publication.

 

## Repository Structure

 

- **Enigma Obfuscation/** — Implementation of the Enigma framework, including modules for topology perturbation, structural camouflage, and coefficient masking, together with the orchestration pipeline used to transform optimization instances.

 

- **ML Adversaries/** — Machine-learning–based attacker models and scripts used to evaluate resistance to repository-based inference.

 

## Reproducibility

 

The artifact supports end-to-end reproduction of the experimental workflow described in the paper and includes:

 

- Graph generators and benchmark instances 

- Scripts for constructing adversarial repositories 

- Training and evaluation pipelines 

- Configuration files used in the reported experiments 

 

Setup instructions and dependencies are documented within each directory.

 

## Anonymity Notice

 

This repository has been anonymized for double-blind review and contains no identifying information about the authors or their institutions.

 

## Availability

 

A cleaned, fully documented version of this artifact will be released under a permissive open-source license upon publication.
